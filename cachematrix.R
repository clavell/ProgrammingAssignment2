## These functions will take a matrix and store it and its inverse
## in a different environment i.e. cache them

## This function creates the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse and stores the matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
